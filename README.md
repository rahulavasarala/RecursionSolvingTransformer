This is a custom implementation of the transformer model inspired by Ajay Halthor(Code emporium)
and Jsbaan's implementation(but not directly forked)

This framework includes unit tests(although they are light hearted), for each module of the transformer to ensure its
functionality. It also includes implementation for beam search, and closely copies the description of the transformer
introduced in attention is all you need

The aim of this transformer framework is to create a model that can solve complex multidimensional recurrence relations
used in optimization such as BFGS, and simpler ones such as 1D polynomial recurrence relations.
